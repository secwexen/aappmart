# AAPP‑MART Documentation

AAPP‑MART (Autonomous Agent & Predictive Processing Framework) is a modular AI-driven framework designed for autonomous agents, predictive task processing, and scalable tool integration.  
This documentation provides a complete overview of the framework’s architecture, components, usage patterns, and installation guidance.

## Overview

Modern infrastructures are too complex for traditional security testing.  
AAPP‑MART combines predictive AI with autonomous agent-based simulation to continuously evaluate an environment’s attack surface.  

It consists of two major components:

- **AAPP (AI Attack Path Predictor)** — Predicts likely attack paths by analyzing systems, services, permissions, and vulnerabilities.  
- **MART (Multi-Agent Red Team)** — Executes autonomous red team simulations to emulate real attacker behavior.  

Together, they create a fully automated offensive security engine capable of forecasting attacks end-to-end.

---

## Platform Support

AAPP‑MART is a **cross-platform Python project** and runs on:

- Linux  
- macOS  
- Windows  

No platform-specific dependencies are required.

---

## Getting Started

AAPP‑MART is built on a modular architecture with the following layers:

- **Core** — Orchestrator, pipeline engine, task manager, knowledge graph, simulation engine  
- **Agents** — System, network, forensic, and custom autonomous agents  
- **Predictors** — Machine learning, rule-based, and hybrid predictive models  
- **Modules** — System, network, memory, automation, and controlled testing tools  
- **API** — REST and WebSocket interfaces  
- **CLI** — Command-line interface for interacting with the framework  
- **Utils** — Logging, configuration, validation helpers  
- **Data** — Sample datasets and model files

---

## Installation

> ⚠️ **Note:** AAPP‑MART is currently under active development.  
> Installation instructions will be provided after the first stable release.

For development setup, you can clone the repository and create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/secwexen/aappmart
cd aappmart

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized as follows:

* [Installation](installation.md)
* [Agents](agents.md)
* [Predictors](predictors.md)
* [Modules](modules.md)
* [API Reference](api_reference.md)
* [Architecture Overview](architecture.md)

## Architecture Overview

AAPP‑MART consists of three primary layers:

1. **Agent Layer**
   Autonomous units responsible for executing tasks and interacting with modules.

2. **Predictive Processing Layer**
   Models and logic that support decision-making and task prioritization.

3. **Modular Tool Layer**
   System, network, memory, and automation tools used by agents.

All layers are coordinated by the **Orchestrator** and connected via the **Pipeline** system.

---

## Examples

Example usage scenarios are provided in the `examples/` directory:

* `examples/basic_usage.py`
* `examples/custom_agent_example.py`
* `examples/pipeline_example.py`

**Python usage example:**

```python
from aappmart.core.orchestrator import AAPP_MART

engine = AAPP_MART(target="192.168.1.10")
engine.run()

report = engine.get_report()
print(report)
```

> ⚠️ Core implementation is still in progress. Some modules may not be fully functional yet.
