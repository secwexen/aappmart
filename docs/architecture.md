# AAPP-MART Architecture

AAPP-MART is a modular, extensible, and autonomous security analysis framework.  
It combines AI-driven Attack Path Prediction (AAPP) with a Multi-Agent Red Team (MART) engine.

This document outlines the system architecture, core components, and internal data flow.

---

## 1. High-Level Overview

AAPP-MART consists of three major subsystems:

1. **AAPP (Attack Path Predictor)**  
   Builds attack graphs, predicts likely attack paths, and prioritizes risks.

2. **MART (Multi-Agent Red Team)**  
   Simulates attacker behavior using autonomous agents.

3. **CORE (Simulation Brain)**  
   Orchestrates AAPP + MART, manages global state, and controls execution.

All components communicate through a shared **Knowledge Graph**.

## 3. Component Breakdown

### 3.1 AAPP — Attack Path Predictor

Responsible for:

- Parsing target data  
- Building attack graphs  
- Predicting attack paths  
- Scoring risks  

Key modules:

- `analyzer.py`
- `graph_builder.py`
- `predictor.py`
- `scoring.py`
- `models/`

---

### 3.2 MART — Multi-Agent Red Team

Simulates attacker behavior using specialized agents:

- Reconnaissance  
- Exploitation  
- Privilege escalation  
- Lateral movement  
- Persistence  
- Reporting  

All agents inherit from `agent_base.py` and share memory via the Knowledge Graph.

---

### 3.3 CORE — Simulation Brain

Coordinates the entire system:

- Runs AAPP  
- Initializes MART agents  
- Executes simulation loops  
- Maintains global state  
- Generates final reports  

Key modules:

- `orchestrator.py`
- `simulation_engine.py`
- `knowledge_graph.py`

---

## 4. Knowledge Graph

Stores:

- Hosts  
- Services  
- Vulnerabilities  
- Credentials  
- Attack paths  
- Agent findings  

Acts as the shared memory for all agents.

---

## 5. Data Flow

```
Input → AAPP → Knowledge Graph → MART → Reports
```

---

## 6. Extensibility

AAPP-MART supports:

- New agents  
- New ML models  
- New scoring algorithms  
- New simulation modes  

---

## 7. Summary

AAPP-MART integrates predictive attack modeling with autonomous red-team simulation.  
Its architecture is modular, scalable, and designed for advanced security research.
