### Autonomous Attack Path Prediction & Multi-Agent Red Team Engine

AAPP-MART is an autonomous offensive security engine that predicts attack paths using artificial intelligence and simulates them with a multi-agent red team. By identifying risks before they occur, it forms the world’s first fully automated attack simulation brain.

---

## Overview

Modern infrastructures are too complex for traditional security testing. AAPP-MART combines predictive AI with autonomous adversarial simulation to continuously evaluate an environment’s real attack surface.

The system operates in two major components:

- **AAPP (AI Attack Path Predictor)**  
  Predicts the most likely attack paths by analyzing services, permissions, vulnerabilities, and configuration weaknesses.

- **MART (Multi-Agent Red Team)**  
  Executes autonomous red team simulations using specialized AI agents that emulate real attacker behavior.

Together, they create a fully automated offensive security engine capable of forecasting and simulating attacks end-to-end.

---

## Key Features

### AI Attack Path Prediction (AAPP)
- Builds attack graphs from system data  
- Identifies multi-step exploit chains  
- Scores risk and exploitability  
- Predicts attacker movement before it happens  

### Multi-Agent Red Team (MART)
- Reconnaissance agent  
- Exploitation agent  
- Privilege escalation agent  
- Lateral movement agent  
- Persistence agent  
- Reporting agent  

Agents collaborate and make decisions autonomously, simulating realistic adversary behavior.

### Autonomous Simulation Brain
- Merges prediction and execution  
- Runs attack scenarios mentally before performing them  
- Generates detailed reports and mitigation recommendations
