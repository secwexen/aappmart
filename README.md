*An autonomous intelligence engine that thinks like an attacker to protect defenders.*

For a high-level explanation of the project’s purpose and positioning,
see [ABOUT.md](ABOUT.md).

### Autonomous Attack Path Prediction & Multi-Agent Red Team Engine

AAPP-MART is an autonomous offensive security engine designed for security teams and researchers.
It predicts attack paths using artificial intelligence and simulates them with a multi-agent red team,
helping organizations identify and mitigate risks before they are exploited.  


for detailed documentation, please visit [Website](https://secwexen.github.io/aappmart/)

---

## Overview

Modern infrastructures are too complex for traditional security testing. AAPP-MART combines predictive AI with autonomous adversarial simulation to continuously evaluate an environment’s real attack surface.

### Why AAPP-MART?

AAPP-MART stands out from traditional offensive security tools in its approach:

- **Traditional scanners** → static, reactive, often limited to known vulnerabilities.
- **BAS (Breach & Attack Simulation) tools** → rely on predefined playbooks and limited scenarios.
- **AAPP-MART** → predictive, autonomous, and adaptive: forecasts attack paths and executes intelligent multi-agent simulations.

By combining **AI-driven attack path prediction** with **autonomous red team simulations**, AAPP-MART provides organizations with a forward-looking security posture, not just reactive alerts.

---

## System Components

The system operates in two major components:

- **AAPP (AI Attack Path Predictor)**  
  Predicts the most likely attack paths by analyzing services, permissions, vulnerabilities, and configuration weaknesses.

- **MART (Multi-Agent Red Team)**  
  Executes autonomous red team simulations using specialized AI agents that emulate real attacker behavior.

Together, they create a fully automated offensive security engine capable of forecasting and simulating attacks end-to-end.

---

## Threat Model & Scope

AAPP-MART simulates attacker behavior at the following layers:
- Network-level (services, ports, exposure)
- Identity & permission abuse
- Known vulnerability chaining
- Misconfiguration exploitation

Out of scope:
- Zero-click mass exploitation
- Malware delivery to uncontrolled targets
- Destructive payload execution

These boundaries are enforced by design and configuration defaults to ensure safe, authorized, and ethical use.

---

## Input & Output Contract

### Inputs
AAPP-MART consumes structured security-relevant data, such as:
- Target identifiers (IP address, hostname, environment label)
- Asset and service metadata
- Optional vulnerability scan results
- Optional configuration and permission data

### Outputs
The engine produces analytical security artifacts, including:
- Predicted attack paths
- Simulated adversary decision flows
- Risk-scored findings
- Human-readable reports with mitigation guidance

---

## Modes of Operation

AAPP-MART operates in controlled modes designed for authorized security assessment
and defensive validation.

### Prediction-Only Mode
- No active interaction with the target
- Builds attack graphs and forecasts attacker movement
- Safe for continuous assessment and design-time analysis

### Simulation Mode
- Executes non-destructive, controlled attack simulations
- Focuses on logic flow rather than payload execution
- Designed for lab environments and authorized testing only

Destructive actions and uncontrolled exploitation are intentionally excluded.

---

## MITRE ATT&CK Alignment

AAPP-MART aligns its prediction and simulation logic with the MITRE ATT&CK framework
to ensure standardized, explainable, and defensible security findings.

Agent behaviors and predicted attack paths are mapped to high-level ATT&CK tactics
and techniques, including but not limited to:

- Reconnaissance → TA0043
- Initial Access → TA0001
- Credential Access → TA0006
- Privilege Escalation → TA0004
- Lateral Movement → TA0008
- Persistence → TA0003

This mapping is used for risk scoring, reporting, and defensive recommendations.

---

## Key Features

### AI Attack Path Prediction (AAPP)
- Builds attack graphs from system data  
- Identifies multi-step exploit chains  
- Scores risk and exploitability  
- Predicts attacker movement before it happens  

### Multi-Agent Red Team (MART)
- Reconnaissance agent  
- Exploitation agent  
- Privilege escalation agent  
- Lateral movement agent  
- Persistence agent  
- Reporting agent  

Agents collaborate and make decisions autonomously, simulating realistic adversary behavior.

### Autonomous Simulation Brain
- Merges prediction and execution  
- Runs attack scenarios mentally before performing them  
- Generates detailed reports and mitigation recommendations
