# About AAPP-MART

AAPP-MART is an autonomous attack path prediction and adversarial simulation engine
designed to support defensive security assessment.

The project focuses on modeling how attackers think and move through complex systems,
without performing real-world exploitation or destructive actions.

---

## What This Project Is

- A breach and attack simulation (BAS) framework
- An attack path modeling and forecasting engine
- A defensive security validation tool
- A research platform for autonomous adversarial reasoning

---

## What This Project Is Not

- Not an exploitation framework
- Not a malware delivery system
- Not a command-and-control platform
- Not a tool for unauthorized access or real-world attacks

---

## Why This Project Exists

Traditional security testing struggles to keep up with modern, dynamic infrastructures.
AAPP-MART exists to help organizations anticipate attacker behavior before a breach occurs,
allowing defenders to focus on the most realistic and impactful risks.

## Intended Users

- Security engineers
- Blue teams and SOC analysts
- Red team researchers (authorized environments only)
- Security architects and risk analysts

---

## Ethical and Legal Position

AAPP-MART is designed exclusively for ethical, legal, and authorized security research.
The project enforces strict boundaries to prevent misuse and does not implement
weaponized payloads or destructive capabilities.
